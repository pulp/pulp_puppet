Pulp 2.4 Release Notes
======================

Pulp 2.4.0
==========

New Features
------------

-  Install and update operations can now be performed with puppet version 3.3+
   against a pulp repository. See :ref:`install_post_33`.

-  Pulp's puppet distributor is now updated to publish to /var/lib/pulp/puppet
   instead of /var/www/pulp_puppet.

API Changes
-----------

* The sync progress report's modules section has changed the way it reports errors with individual
  modules. The ``modules`` sub-object has an ``individual_errors`` attribute that used to index a
  JSON object, with module names (including version) as keys. Pulp stores this data structure in
  MongoDB, which led to `bug #1072580 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1072580>`_
  because the module versions use periods which are illegal characters to use as document keys. The
  ``individual_errors`` attribute now indexes a list of JSON objects, and each JSON object has these
  keys: ``module`` (which is formatted as "name-version"), ``author``, ``exception``, and
  ``traceback``. ``individual_errors`` used to be null when there weren't any errors, but would
  be an object if there were errors. Now ``individual_errors`` will always be an array. It will be
  empty when there are no errors.
